## Overview

This portfolio is built using modern web development technologies to ensure a fast, reliable, and visually appealing experience. It features a dynamic interface that supports server-side rendering and static generation, and it leverages the best practices in code quality and performance.

## Tech Stack

### Core Framework & Build Tools

- **Next.js (v15.2.4):** The primary React framework used for server-rendered and statically generated applications.
- **TypeScript (v5.8.2):** Provides static type checking to improve code quality and development efficiency.
- **ESLint & Prettier:** Enforces code quality and maintains consistent code formatting with Next.js-specific linting rules.

### Styling & Theming

- **Emotion:** CSS-in-JS libraries (`@emotion/react` and `@emotion/styled`) for component-scoped styling.
- **Tailwind CSS (v3.4.17):** Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development, enhanced with `tailwind-merge` and `tailwindcss-animate`.
- **SCSS & Sass:** Used for advanced CSS management and preprocessing capabilities.

### UI Components & Libraries

- **Magic UI (Custom Redefined):** Utilizes Magic UI components that have been redefined to align with the unique design requirements of this project.
- **Radix UI:** Offers accessible, unstyled UI primitives which can be customized as needed.
- **ShadCN UI:** Modern UI components designed for contemporary styling patterns.
- **React Icons & Lucide:** A collection of scalable vector icons to enrich the UI.
- **Material UI (MUI):** Provides a rich set of pre-built components following Material Design principles.


### Motion & Animations

- **Framer Motion (v11.18.2) & Motion (v12.5.0):** Enables smooth animations and transitions within the application.
- **React Tooltip:** Adds interactive tooltip functionality for enhanced user experience.

### Utility Libraries & Helpers

- **Axios & Node-Fetch:** HTTP client libraries to handle API requests efficiently.
- **Date-FNS (v4.1.0):** Facilitates date manipulation and formatting.
- **Classnames & clsx:** Helps with dynamic and conditional CSS class management.
- **Cobe:** Used for creative visualizations or data processing tasks.
- **Other Tools:** Includes `dotenv` for managing environment variables, `fs-extra` for file system operations, and additional utilities to streamline development.

### GraphQL & API Interaction

- **Custom GraphQL API for GitHub & LeetCode:**  
  Implements an aggressive GraphQL API that integrates with both GitHub and LeetCode. This custom API employs batch data fetching techniques to optimize performance and minimize HTTP requests.


### Additional Tooling & Libraries

- **SVGR & Webpack:** Transforms SVG files into React components, making it easier to incorporate scalable vector graphics.
- **Next Themes & Vercel Analytics:** Manages theme switching (e.g., dark/light mode) and integrates performance analytics from Vercel.
- **CLI Tools:** Utilizes `chalk`, `commander`, and `ora` for command-line functionality and build scripts.

Below is the revised markdown for the sections following **Getting Started**:


## Getting Started

To set up the project locally and start exploring the code, follow these steps:
